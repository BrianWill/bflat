-  are method and field name collision in class a problem?
    and what about name collisions with members of ancestor classes?

- property auto creates field with same name but ending in underscore
    
    static

    allow initial value for property like with field? how distinguish from start of getter? -val flag?





- account for member access levels



- build up full directory of source file paths under the base directory at the beginning
        check for namespace name conflicts



- account for conflicting overloads in subclasses, subinterfaces 
        (does C# allow subclass to create overload that effectively hides parent?)

- should require -override (and generate "override" keyword) for overriding methods


- out and ref params






- generics


- indexer methods


- walk bf. directories to find namespace source files
- allow for . in namespace name in ns form

(ns red.orange.blue)      // 'blue' is the short name; (in C#, equivalent of Red.Orange.Blue) 

                          // file convention: shortname_file.bf
                          // e.g. file 'foo' in namespace with shortname 'bar':
                          //            bar_foo.bf



(import red.orange.blue -alias something)       // in case shortname conflicts with other import, give it alias
