I'VE FIGURED OUT INDEXING/DOT SYNTAX

general syntax for indexing and field access is with []:

    [a 0 .foo .ack 234 .bla]   // a[0].foo.ack[234].bla
    [bar (foo 3) .ack]         // bar[foo(3)].bar.ack
    [x .y .z]                  // x.y.z
    [(foo 3) .bar .ack]        // (foo 3).bar.ack
    
the space before 'dot-name' can be ommitted when the dot-name follows another dot-name or the first element of the []

    [a 0 .foo.ack 234 .bla]   // a[0].foo.ack[234].bla
    [bar (foo 3) .ack]        // bar[foo(3)].bar.ack
    [x.y.z]                   // x.y.z
    [(foo 3).bar.ack]         // foo(3).bar.ack

when the elements inside [] have no spaces between them, the surrounding [] can be omitted

    [a 0 .foo.ack 234 .bla]   // [] required
    [bar (foo 3) .ack]        // [] required
    x.y.z                     // [] omitted
    (foo 3).bar.ack           // [] omitted

effectively, the [] are only required where indexing is involved

// accounts for newlines in the inserted text
func insertTextMultiline : text Str textBuffer A<Str> c Cursor
    let lines (split text `\n`)
    if (eq lines.length 1)
        insertText text textBuffer cursor
        return
    let line [textBuffer c.line]
    let preceding (slice line 0 c.pos)
    let following (slice line c.pos)
    as [lines 0] (add preceding [lines 0])
    as c.pos [lines (dec lines.length) .length]
    as c.preferredPos c.pos
    as [lines (dec lines.length)] (add [lines (dec lines.length)] following)
    splice textBuffer c.line 1 -xp lines
    asAdd c.line (dec lines.length)
    as c.selectionPos c.pos
    as c.selectionLine c.line
    updateMaxScroll


because we want to avoid private helper functions nesting too far away from the
    margin, we define a private helper function in a helper form at top level 
    instead of inside the function they belong to:


helper names given a highlight color similar to that of local variables, but they are not really locals


// for a method in a class/struct, the helper form goes inside the class

 func foo
    something
    
    // helpers ack and bar private to foo
    -help
    func ack Str         
        other

    -help
    func bar
        something

    // helper bar private to helper ack of foo
    -help ack
    func bar Z : a A b B         
        bla bla

    // helper zap private to helper bar of ack of foo
    -help ack bar
    func zap Str : n I         
        bla bla


// OK to have multiple helper forms for same function/helper? don't see reason to allow this, just feels like bad style



GO BACK TO INDENTATION-SENSATIVE SYNTAX
    all lines except those beginning with symbols implicitly begin with (

    even lines starting with explicit ( have an implicit ( because you might want:

        (foo a b)
            d e

    ...with implicit parens surrounding 

    use comma at start to supress implicit starting paren

    if you want a string/number literal as first element in () that spans multiple lines:

        (`hi` a b
            c
            d
    
    ...or even:

        (
            `hi` a b
            c
            d

    open delimiters not closed on their own line given special highlighting

    error if an implicit end paren matches an open paren on 
        same line that isn't at start of line (or isn't just after starting comma)

    end delimiters at end of line with no matching open delimiter are stripped by editing auto-correction


when editing from known successful compilation state, edited lines are highlighted until the 
    code successfully compiles again
    one color to mean the edited lines don't parse, another color to mean there's a semantic problem
    another color if the edited code now compiles but compilation errors have 
    been introduced elsewhere (indicated by other highlighting on those problems)


how to extract switch case to private helper without having to give it a name?
    want to punt it to bottom, but let it automatically have identifier identical to the 
        case expression, even if it's an expression?

    casefunc `foo`       // private helper function that matches casefunc of switch above
        // maybe have to give the switch itself a name?

        // or just use autoId names (shown in editor as identicons)
        // 'anonymous' functions that aren't really anonymous, they just don't have a visible name

        // editor can have identiconHash's on any line (just draws line with extra space before next line 
                // to fit the identicon)
        // what about lineheight identicons (long rectangles); or perhaps wide rectangle taking up two lines vertically



-  static property    

    allow initial value for property like with field?

- interface properties (and fields?)

    check class actually has to implement the properties

    - what about name collision between method and property of same interface? allowed or not?

- account for member access levels


- indexing form should be left-to-right like conventional order: [object field] [array index] 

- special assignment that creates variable in scope only of next line of the same block
   -- or perhaps goes out of scope after its use on a subsequent line
    -- (so can occur multiple times on that line, but doesn't exist after)

    ast a 3          // assign temp
    as x (add a 9)
    as y a           // error because a doesn't exist here


block x y : a b     // x y created and exist beyond the block; a and b are only other outer block variables accessible in the block
                    // cannot assign to a and b unless marked? a second colon for variables that are read/write? what about indexing ops?
                    // types of x and y inferred from assignments in the block, but if any ambiguity, type must be denoted


- override and virtual

- out and ref params

- import shortname aliases

- generic methods

- generic classes

- extension methods

- indexer methods







(import red:orange:blue -alias something)       // in case shortname conflicts with other import, give it alias
