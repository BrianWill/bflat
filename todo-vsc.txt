- paren hiding



-- constraints:

    indent is always multiple of 4 spaces

    starting unmatched open paren should have single-indent and/or double-indent block after it

    starting open paren is closed at end of block

    single-indent block only after line starting open paren


    interior open delimiter is followed by double-indent block

    double-indent block only follows line with interior open delimiter

    interior open delimiter is closed at end of double-indent block

    no open delimiter at end of line


-- todo what about non-paren delimiters spanning multiple lines?
