look at carota

    uses div container for scroll bar; as scrolling, set style.top on position absolute canvas within, and 
    redraw canavs to account for new scroll position


paste

copy, cut


line numbering

vertical scroll


bundle cursor pos and selection info into a global object


option-arrow (skips over immediately adjacent spaces/tabs, putting cursor right before next space/tab over)








offscreen canvas buffers for smooth scrolling (use at least 3, and copy from these buffers to onscreen canvas)

shift selection

mouse click for place cursor

mouse selection

search and replace

undo/redo

multi-tabs

efficient text buffer using TextArea? (presumably it could avoid producing so much garbage as user types)
    native byte array? 

    function bin2String(array) {
        return String.fromCharCode.apply(String, array);
    }

    use views w/ buffers?


don't preventDefault for some browser hotkeys (reload?, new tab? ctrl-s should not print a character)



horizontal scroll

word wrapping

option to insert actual tab characters instead of spaces

support tab size other than 4 spaces


when moving cursor, changing selection, only redraw lines that need to be redrawn instead of whole canvas
