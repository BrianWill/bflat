look at carota

    uses div container for scroll bar; as scrolling, set style.top on position absolute canvas within, and 
    redraw canavs to account for new scroll position


given currentScroll, figure out which lines are in view and only 
    loop over those lines in drawText() (depends upon height of editor)

    figure out maxScroll from number of lines



vertical scroll

set vertical scroll when cursor moves up down


highlight line with cursor


bundle cursor pos and selection info into a global object




shift selection

copy, cut



offscreen canvas buffers for smooth scrolling (use at least 3, and copy from these buffers to onscreen canvas)
    cursor is never rendered on off-screen bufffers, always rendered last on top of dispaly canvas


mouse click for place cursor

mouse selection

search and replace

undo/redo

multi-tabs

efficient text buffer using TextArea? (presumably it could avoid producing so much garbage as user types)
    native byte array? 

    function bin2String(array) {
        return String.fromCharCode.apply(String, array);
    }

    use views w/ buffers?


don't preventDefault for some browser hotkeys (reload?, new tab? ctrl-s should not print a character)



horizontal scroll

word wrapping

option to insert actual tab characters instead of spaces

support tab size other than 4 spaces





firefox: dom.events.async.clipboard must be enabled in about:config? or is that only for file:///
    chrome will ask for permission repeatedly for clipboard permission when viewing page via file:/// 
        (serving via localhost fixes problem)

prev/nextWhitespaceSkip should not skip past ( ) { } [ ]  ? desired behavior depends upon language mode
