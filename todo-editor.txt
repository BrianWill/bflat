multi-line editing



option-arrow (skips over immediately adjacent spaces/tabs, putting cursor right before next space/tab over)


copy-paste

offscreen canvas buffers for smooth scrolling (use at least 3, and copy from these buffers to onscreen canvas)

shift selection

mouse click for place cursor

mouse selection


efficient text buffer using TextArea? (presumably it could avoid producing so much garbage as user types)
    native byte array? 

    function bin2String(array) {
        return String.fromCharCode.apply(String, array);
    }

    use views w/ buffers?


don't preventDefault for some browser hotkeys (reload?, new tab? ctrl-s should not print a character)


vertical scroll
horizontal scroll


when moving cursor, changing selection, only redraw lines that need to be redrawn instead of whole canvas


support for variable-width fonts
